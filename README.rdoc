CloseBuy is a Craigslist Webscraper API I created using Nokogiri as a portion of my final project for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive Course. The API scrapes the Item title, Item Description, Main Photograph, E-mail, and Phone number for all for sale items in the San Francisco Bay Area's For Sale section on Craigslist.
